## Development Process

### Setup Development Environment

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/flowboard.git`
3. Install dependencies: `composer install && npm install`
4. Copy environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
5. Generate application key: `php artisan key:generate`
6. Run migrations: `php artisan migrate --seed`
7. Start development: `composer dev`

### Code Style

#### PHP
* Follow PSR-12 coding standards
* Use Laravel Pint for code formatting: `vendor/bin/pint`
* Write meaningful variable and method names
* Add type hints for all parameters and return types

#### JavaScript
* Use ES6+ features
* Follow Alpine.js conventions for Livewire components
* Use meaningful variable names
* Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

#### CSS
* Use TailwindCSS utility classes
* Follow mobile-first responsive design
* Use semantic class names for custom components
* Maintain consistent spacing and typography

### Testing

* Write tests for new features
* Ensure all tests pass: `composer test`
* Maintain test coverage above 80%
* Test both happy path and edge cases

### Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Database Changes

* Create migrations for all database changes
* Use descriptive migration names
* Add appropriate indexes
* Update model relationships
* Add factory and seeder updates if needed

### Security Considerations

* Never commit secrets or API keys
